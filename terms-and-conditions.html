          <h3>4. Order Process</h3>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Order validation. We reserve the right to re-check the Order
              details following the final payment to confirm whether the
              requirements of the assignment were met successfully as indicated
              by the Client. Should a mismatch occur, we reserve the right to
              modify the Order to ensure that the Client’s requirements have
              been adhered to.
            </li>
            <li>
              Order volume. Each Order placed by the Client has a required
              volume, that is measured by the number of pages. One page equals
              275 words. Upon the Product delivery the document received has to
              match the expected number of pages metric. Should there be a
              page/number of words mismatch, the Client may request to reformat
              the paper to match the number of words/pages.
            </li>
            <li>
              Changes of Order details. The Client may provide changes to the
              scope of work only if the writer has not started the work yet. No
              changes can be made once the Writer has started researching and
              working on the Order. Should the Order details increase in volume,
              Order complexity or narrow the completion terms, the Client will
              be asked to provide additional compensation for the additional
              instructions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Resources. Should the Client require specific resource material to
              be utilized in the Order process, she/he must specify those
              resources and/or provide them to the Writer.
            </li>
            <li>
              Communication. The Client is highly encouraged to communicate with
              the Writer or our support team using the messaging system of the
              Website or by contacting the support team directly by phone or
              live chat when seeking more information.
            </li>
            <li>
              Progress tracking. The Client may track the progress of his/her
              Orders by using his/her personal Account, where information about
              his/her Order and its status is displayed. The Client may as well

          <b>1. Definitions </b>

          <p>
            “Referral Program” or “RP” means a complex of rules governing the
            process of earning bonuses by the existing Clients for referring
            third persons to the Website in capacity of new Clients, including
            all relevant material terms and conditions of such process and its
            substance.
          </p>

          <p>
            “Bonus” means discount for the Services represented in the form of
            coupon – an electronic document, which has specific characteristics:
            (i) the amount of the discount is 10$, (ii) term of its validity is
            30 calendar days, and (iii) eligible to be used with the single
            Order, which price exceeds 25$; it expires automatically.
          </p>

          <p>
            “Referring Client” means existing Client, which refers to the third
            person to the Website in capacity of new Clients, eligible for
            Bonus.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Referred Client” means third person, which was referred by the
            Referring Client and, upon acceptance of T&C and further use of the
            Website, constitutes a new Client, eligible for Bonus.
          </p>

          <b>2. ligibility for Referral Program</b>

          <ol>
            <li>
              In order to participate in RP, the Referring Client has to be an
              actual Client in good standing, meaning - being in compliance with
              T&C in force, who has approved and completed at least one Order
              prior to the referral.
            </li>
            <li>
              Any third person, who is eligible to become a Client, may become a
              Referred Client, and no specific requirements, except provided by
              these Referral Terms, have to be met.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <b>3. Referral Process</b>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Every existing Client, eligible to participate, has an opportunity
              to participate in RP by inviting a third party to use the Services
              of the Website.
            </li>
            <li>
              Invitation has to be done using the Client’s interface – clicking
              the tab “Invite a friend”, which is located in the Client’s
              Account. The Client would be able to copy the invitation link,
              which leads to the Website, and send it to any third person
              (“Invited Person”) by any means of choice (e-mail, messengers,
              etc.)
            </li>
            <li>
              The Invited Person may follow the link and register an Account
              according to the T&C, thus becoming a Referred Client.
            </li>
            <li>
              Such Referred Client receives Bonus to his/her Account
              automatically at the moment of registration. This Bonus would be
              automatically applied to the first (or the next one in case of
              Referring Client) Order. Confirmation of the Order with such
              discount constitutes its appropriate use and shall exhaust it.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Referring Client receives Bonus to his/her Account each time
              the Referred Client(s) uses Bonus appropriately at the moment when
              Referred Client finishes the Order. Algorithm of such Referring
              Client’s Bonus use is the same as for the Referred Client.
            </li>
            <li>
              Neither Referring, nor Referred Client may use more than one Bonus
              per one Order. At the same time, Bonuses are not cumulative.
            </li>
            <li>
              The number of invitation links, so as the number of Referred
              Clients, issued by one Referring Client is limitless.
            </li>
            <li>
              In no case the Bonus shall be provided in any other form
              (including cash, wire transfer) than the coupon with a discount.
            </li>
            <li>
              Bonus does not stick with another Bonus, or any other discount
              provided by Us.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <b> 4. Restrictions and limitations </b>

          <ol>
            <li>
              The invitation link should only be used for personal and
              non-commercial purposes, such as sale or barter. It also should
              not be published or distributed by any commercial means, such as
              coupon website, or by improper means, such as “spamming” (meaning
              unsolicited commercial advertisement in scope of Law of the United
              States CAN-SPAM Act of 2003).
            </li>
            <li>
              Multiply referrals are allowed and no number of referrals sent
              shall be deemed as abuse of these rules.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <b
            >5. We reserve the right to suspend/terminate the Referral Program
            or alternate the rules upon any reason we deem appropriate.</b

          <b
            >6. If We reasonably suspect that You, either as Referring or
            Referred Client, act abusively, fraudulently, or in violation of
            Referral Program, we may suspend Your access and, consequently,
